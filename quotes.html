                        I think a program like SAS Reach is only as great as you make it for yourself. 
                        The coordinators put in a ton of effort to open doors for the students, 
                        but it is <strong>up to the student</strong> to take advantage of the people that they are able to bring into the room. 
                        Be <strong>open to learning</strong>, I developed some very important soft skills while I was with the SAS Reach group. 
                        As somebody who had a really bad stutter, 
                        I made it a goal to talk as much as I could to practice and get rid of my nervousness and insecurity around the way I spoke. 
                        Now I feel like the <strong>most confident and best version of myself</strong> possible. 
                        Again, a program like SAS Reach is amazing and puts so many opportunities in front of you but it is up to the students to be proactive with those opportunities.

                        Apply. It's going to be scary applying to internships or jobs, especially dealing with interviews, 
                        but you do yourself a disservice if you don't try. I would <strong>recommend anyone to apply</strong> regardless of how capable they felt. 
                        You'll more than likely realize you are way <strong>more able than you think.</strong> Sometimes it takes others seeing something in you for you to see it too. 
                        Also, don't ever let rejection make you feel uncapable. It is chance to see where you can grow.

						A non-traditional internship, like the SAS Reach program allows <strong>more room for growth</strong> in my opinion. 
						In this internship I was exposed to many different occupations and positions within the company. 
						Coming into this program there was nothing I NEEDED to know, everything was about being <strong>open minded and willing to learn.</strong> 
						This experience was more beneficial as someone who didn't know a lot about the professional world.</p>

                        This program has made me more <strong>aware of my surroundings</strong> 
                        because it taught me that you could meet anyone in public 
                        but not know that they could possibly be a person that could <strong>help you in the future. </strong>
                        I should be ready to meet anyone. It hasn't really changed by behaviors or started new ones.

                        The most impactful lessons I've learned from the SAS Reach program 
                        are the importance of <strong>connecting with people</strong> and following up with them, 
                        as well as stepping out of my comfort zone to <strong>ask questions and be curious.</strong> 
                        These lessons have significantly benefited me, both during the program and in the long run.

                        I've also learned about <strong>different job opportunities</strong> and I also learned about different skills required.

                        I would definitely say that you should learn to <strong>speak up and talk to new people.</strong>
                        Being quiet does not put a good impression. Also, understand that people are spending time to help you grow,
                        so make sure to not waste their time and <strong>thank them.</strong>
